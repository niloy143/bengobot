# Feature Specification: BengoBot MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-bengobot-mvp-build`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "bengobot mvp, build the mvp version of bengobot. for mvp, bengobot will have these features: 

1. openai integrated
2. user will provide the api key of openai to start using it
3. user will get a embedable iframe element that they can insert in their website and then the bengobot's chatbot UI will be available there
4. some security mechanism to ensure the targeted user get's his targeted embedded iframe link
5. a knowledge base mechanism that the AI will use as it's context to answer the queries of the customers
6. user will be able to put the knowledge text that our AI will be able to use as the context when chatting with customers only for that user (business owner).
7. obviously a login mechanism since we are talking about 'user' aka business owners. 
8. knowledge base will be per user.

what should work in this version?
- user must be able to login
- user gets his embedded iframe
- chat popup appears in the frontend of the user's site
- customers are able to chat with the chatbot from that embedded iframe link."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website owner, I want to embed an AI chatbot on my website so that my customers can get instant answers to their questions using my website's content, allowing me to provide 24/7 customer support without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a business owner has signed up for BengoBot, **When** they provide their OpenAI API key and add knowledge base content, **Then** they receive a unique embeddable iframe code for their website.
2. **Given** a business owner has embedded the iframe on their website, **When** a customer visits the website and clicks the chat button, **Then** a chatbot interface appears allowing the customer to ask questions.
3. **Given** a customer is chatting with the chatbot, **When** they ask a question related to the business's knowledge base, **Then** the chatbot provides accurate answers based on the business owner's provided content.
4. **Given** a business owner has logged into their BengoBot account, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can manage their knowledge base content and view chat analytics.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's OpenAI API key is invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle multiple concurrent chat sessions?
- What security measures prevent unauthorized access to iframe links?
- How does the system handle customers asking questions outside the knowledge base scope?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow business owners to create accounts and log in securely
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow business owners to input and store their OpenAI API key
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate unique embeddable iframe code for each business owner
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide security mechanisms to ensure iframe links are only accessible to the intended business owner
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow business owners to create and manage knowledge base content specific to their business
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with OpenAI to generate responses using the business owner's knowledge base as context
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a chat interface on the business owner's website when the iframe is embedded
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable customers to send messages to the chatbot through the embedded interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide AI-generated responses to customer queries based on the business owner's knowledge base
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure each business owner's knowledge base is isolated and only used for their customers

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle chat sessions for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum concurrent users per business owner not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain chat history for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Business Owner**: Represents the user who signs up for BengoBot, with attributes like email, password, API key, and unique identifier
- **Knowledge Base**: Collection of text content provided by business owner, associated with their account for AI context
- **Chat Session**: Represents a conversation between a customer and the chatbot, linked to the business owner
- **Iframe Configuration**: Contains the unique embed code and security tokens for each business owner
