# Research Findings: BengoBot MVP

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Next.js Full-Stack Framework
**Rationale**: Next.js provides both frontend and backend capabilities in a single framework, enabling rapid development of the MVP while maintaining good separation of concerns through API routes. The App Router provides modern React patterns and excellent performance.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate Express.js backend + React frontend: More complex deployment and development setup
- SvelteKit: Less mature ecosystem for enterprise features
- Remix: Good but steeper learning curve for the team

### Decision: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Rationale**: PostgreSQL provides robust data integrity, JSON support for flexible knowledge base storage, and excellent performance. Prisma offers type-safe database access and automatic migrations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MongoDB: Flexible schema but less relational integrity for user management
- SQLite: Simple but not suitable for multi-tenant SaaS scaling
- Supabase: Good but vendor lock-in concerns

### Decision: Tailwind CSS for Styling
**Rationale**: Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development and consistent design system. Excellent for component-based architecture and responsive design.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Styled Components: More complex for rapid prototyping
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size and less customization
- Vanilla CSS: Slower development velocity

### Decision: JWT for Authentication
**Rationale**: Stateless authentication suitable for API-based architecture. Secure and widely supported.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based auth: More complex state management
- OAuth providers: Overkill for MVP, adds external dependencies

### Decision: OpenAI GPT-4 for Chat Responses
**Rationale**: Industry-leading language model for generating contextual responses. Well-documented API and good performance.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GPT-3.5: Cheaper but less accurate responses
- Claude: Good but less ecosystem integration
- Local models: Not suitable for MVP timeline and cost

## Architecture Patterns

### Decision: API Routes for Backend Logic
**Rationale**: Next.js API routes provide clean separation between frontend and backend while keeping everything in one codebase.

### Decision: Component-Based Architecture
**Rationale**: React's component model enables reusable UI elements and maintainable code structure.

### Decision: Environment-Based Configuration
**Rationale**: Different settings for development, staging, and production environments.

## Security Considerations

### Decision: API Key Encryption
**Rationale**: OpenAI API keys must be encrypted at rest and never exposed to frontend.

### Decision: CORS Configuration
**Rationale**: Restrict iframe embedding to authorized domains only.

### Decision: Input Validation
**Rationale**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Performance Optimizations

### Decision: Database Indexing
**Rationale**: Index user_id and common query fields for fast retrieval.

### Decision: Response Caching
**Rationale**: Cache frequent knowledge base queries to reduce database load.

### Decision: Lazy Loading
**Rationale**: Load chat components only when needed to reduce initial bundle size.

## Integration Patterns

### Decision: Webhook-Based Chat Processing
**Rationale**: Asynchronous processing of chat messages to handle OpenAI API latency.

### Decision: Embed Code Generation
**Rationale**: Dynamic iframe URLs with user-specific tokens for security.

## Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Vercel for Hosting
**Rationale**: Native Next.js support, excellent performance, and easy scaling.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS: More complex but more control
- Railway: Good but less mature
- Self-hosted: More maintenance overhead

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Decision: Basic Error Tracking
**Rationale**: Log errors and performance metrics for debugging.

### Decision: User Event Tracking
**Rationale**: Track chat interactions for product improvement (privacy-compliant).

## Migration Path

### Decision: Database-First Approach
**Rationale**: Design database schema first, then build application around it for data integrity.

### Decision: Feature Flags
**Rationale**: Enable/disable features for gradual rollout and testing.
