<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
Every feature prioritizes user experience, ease of integration, and accessibility. The chatbot must provide instant, accurate responses with minimal setup.
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### II. Security by Default
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
Implement enterprise-level security measures from the start, ensuring data protection, secure transmissions, and compliance with industry standards.
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### III. Scalable Architecture
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
Design the system to handle growth across pricing tiers, from 1,000 to unlimited conversations, with efficient resource usage.
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### IV. Multilingual Support
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
All features must support multiple languages for global reach, with automatic detection and seamless translation.
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### V. AI-Driven Efficiency
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
Leverage AI for intelligent, context-aware responses that reduce support workload and improve customer satisfaction.
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## Technical Standards
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

Use Next.js with TypeScript for type-safe development, Sass for styling, and Vercel for deployment. Ensure responsive design and SEO optimization.
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

Use ESLint for code quality, Git for version control, and implement testing for reliability. Follow component-based architecture for maintainability.
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

Constitution guides all development decisions. Amendments require documentation and justification. Regular reviews ensure compliance.
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
