# BengoBot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Simplicity
Every feature prioritizes ease of use and accessibility for non-technical users. Website owners must be able to integrate BengoBot with minimal technical knowledge. All interfaces prioritize clarity over complexity, with progressive disclosure of advanced features. Rationale: BengoBot targets website owners who may not be developers, requiring intuitive design that doesn't overwhelm users.

### II. Website Integration First
BengoBot's core value proposition is seamless website embedding. Every architectural decision supports easy HTML/JS integration as the primary deployment method. Integration must work across all major website platforms and content management systems. Rationale: The product exists to enhance websites, so integration complexity directly impacts adoption and user success.

### III. Content-Driven Intelligence
All AI responses must be grounded in the website's actual content. BengoBot extracts and indexes website data to provide accurate, contextual answers. No generic or hallucinated responses allowed - every answer must trace back to source content. Rationale: Trust and accuracy are critical for customer support applications where incorrect information can damage business relationships.

### IV. Scalable SaaS Foundation
Architecture must support growth from single websites to enterprise deployments. Design for horizontal scaling, multi-tenancy, and SaaS monetization from day one. Avoid technical debt that would prevent future scaling. Rationale: BengoBot is positioned as a scalable business platform, requiring infrastructure that can grow with user demand and revenue.

### V. Professional Standards
Maintain enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance. All customer data must be handled with appropriate privacy protections. Uptime and response times must meet commercial service expectations. Rationale: Professional credibility is essential for a customer-facing product that handles sensitive business interactions.

## Technical Standards

### Security Requirements
- All customer data encrypted at rest and in transit
- GDPR and privacy regulation compliance mandatory
- No third-party tracking or data sharing without explicit consent
- Regular security audits and penetration testing required

### Performance Standards
- Chatbot responses under 2 seconds for 95% of queries
- Website integration code under 50KB gzipped
- Support for websites with 10,000+ pages
- 99.9% uptime for production deployments

### Technology Stack
- Modern web technologies (HTML5, ES6+, Web APIs)
- Serverless/cloud-native architecture preferred
- AI/ML models must be lightweight and cost-effective
- Open source dependencies with active maintenance

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code must pass automated testing before merge
- Code review required for all changes
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage minimum 80%
- Integration tests for all website integrations
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Load testing for performance validation

### Deployment Process
- Automated deployment pipelines for all environments
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- Environment parity between development and production

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices and guides all project decisions. Amendments require:
1. Clear rationale for change
2. Impact assessment on existing features
3. Approval from core development team
4. Documentation of change in constitution history
5. Migration plan for any breaking changes

All development work must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified against the user-centric simplicity principle. Use this constitution for guidance on architectural decisions, feature prioritization, and technical trade-offs.
